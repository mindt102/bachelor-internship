# Overview

This is a repository to put together my work in my bachelor internship with ESEO Grande École d'Ingénieurs. The goal of the project was to develop three Git repositories following GitOps philosophy to automate infrastructure deployment and configuration. The repositories are:
- [gitops-openscap](https://github.com/mindt102/gitops-openscap): Automate OpenSCAP integration by handling tool compilation, version tracking, and security compliance scan.
- [gitops-pentestlab](https://github.com/mindt102/gitops-pentestlab): Automate the deployment of a Pentest lab by setting up VPN server and Docker containers of vulnerable applications.
- [gitops-wazuh](https://github.com/mindt102/gitops-wazuh): Automate the deployment of Wazuh server and agents.

More details about the project can be found in the [report](report.pdf).
